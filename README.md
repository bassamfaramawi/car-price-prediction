In this notebook we will work to model US car prices with the available independent variables to help the management of Chinese automobile company "Geely Auto" who aspires to enter the US market to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables.They want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the American market, since those may be very different from the Chinese market. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
